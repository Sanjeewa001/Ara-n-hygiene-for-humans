	<h1>PROGRESS AND INFO</h1>
	<p>Hundreds of millions of people around the world still lack access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services, which are crucial for human health and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Global water consumption has surged at a rate more than twice that of population growth over the last century. Aside from water stress, governments and territories are increasingly confronted with issues such as water pollution, damaged water-related ecosystems, climate-related water scarcity, and a lack of collaboration on transboundary waterways. The world is falling short of achieving Goal 6. The existing rates of improvement, as well as integrated and holistic approaches to water management, must be dramatically accelerated.</br></br>
The number of people using clean drinking water and sanitation services increased by 2 billion and 2.4 billion, respectively, between 2000 and 2020. Despite advances, 2 billion people will be without safe drinking water, 3.6 billion will be without adequate sanitation, and 2.3 billion will be without basic hygiene services in 2020. One in every three individuals in the globe still lacks basic handwashing facilities at home, making them particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus. </br></br>
In 2015, 32 percent of wastewater flows were treated in one way or another among the 42 countries and territories that reported total wastewater generation and treatment. According to data from 128 nations and territories, an estimated 56 percent of wastewater generated by households in 2020 was safely handled. </br></br>
According to a 2020 assessment of 89 countries and territories' rivers, lakes, and aquifers, 72 percent of the water bodies studied have good water quality. Protecting these aquatic bodies from contamination is easier than restoring them, thus efforts to do so must begin immediately. </br></br>

Global water stress was expected to reach 18.4 percent in 2018, up from 18.2 percent the previous year. Water stress is quite high in Western and Southern Asia, as well as Northern Africa, with more than 70%, whereas water stress increased in SouthEastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa from 2017 to 2018. </br></br>
129 nations and territories were on course to miss the 2030 deadline for adopting integrated water resources management, which includes funding and intersectoral coordination structures, basin management, and monitoring, as of 2020. Globally, the rate of implementation must double. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted more stakeholders to participate in water resource management through online discussions in numerous nations and territories. </br></br>
Promoting transboundary water cooperation is critical for avoiding disputes and promoting regional integration, peace, and long-term development. Only 24 of the 153 nations and territories that share transboundary rivers, lakes, and aquifers have 100% of their transboundary basin area covered by operational arrangements, according to data from 2017 and 2020, and another 22 countries and territories have more than 70% covered. </br></br>


Freshwater habitats and the plethora of resources they supply are rapidly changing. Surface water area is rapidly increasing or decreasing in one-fifth of the world's river basins. Pollution in big lakes, as well as the ongoing loss and degradation of wetlands and freshwater biodiversity, have exacerbated this unusual predicament. Inland and marine or coastal wetlands lost nearly 35% of their area between 1970 and 2015, three times the rate of forest loss. Efforts to safeguard and restore water-related ecosystems must be ramped up and intensified as soon as possible. </br></br>
ODA disbursements to the water sector were steady at roughly $8.8 billion from 2015 to 2019, but ODA commitments to the water sector increased by 9%. Concessional financing to the least developed nations climbed by 52% to $2 billion during the same time, while ODA grants to same countries increased by only 8%.</br></br>
Two-thirds of the 109 reporting countries and territories have processes for local community engagement in water and sanitation management outlined in laws or policies in 2018 and 2019. In collaborative management and decision-making, however, just 14 nations and territories indicated high levels of community and user participation. </br></p>
